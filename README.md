- ✅ **WebSocket Real-time**: Live game updates and player synchronization

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Modern UI** with responsive design
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket
- **Comprehensive testing** with Jest and Playwright
- **Port**: 3000

### Backend (`/backend`)
- **Java Spring Boot 2.7.18**
- **PostgreSQL** database with JPA/Hibernate
- **WebSocket** for real-time communication
- **RESTful API** with comprehensive endpoints
- **Automatic scenario loading** from JSON files
- **Port**: 8080

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 16+ and npm
- **Java** 11+ and Maven
- **PostgreSQL** (or use H2 for development)

### ⚡ **RECOMMENDED: Use the Scripts!**

**Stop fighting with port conflicts and process management:**

```bash
# 🚀 Start the entire application (handles everything!)
./start-app.sh

# 🛑 Stop the entire application (kills all processes)
./stop-app.sh

# 🧪 Run ALL tests (backend + frontend + E2E with Playwright)
./test-app.sh
```

### 📱 Manual Setup (If You Must)

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
   ```

2. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Start Frontend** (new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

### 🌐 Access Points
- **Game**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8080/api
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/api/health

## 🧪 Testing

### ⚡ **USE THE TEST SCRIPT!**

```bash
# 🎯 Run ALL tests (backend + frontend + E2E)
./test-app.sh
```

This script runs:
- ✅ **Backend Tests**: Maven unit tests
- ✅ **Frontend Tests**: Jest unit tests with coverage
- ✅ **Playwright E2E Tests**: Full browser automation testing
- ✅ **Scenario Loading Tests**: API endpoint validation

### 🎭 **Playwright E2E Testing**

The project includes comprehensive Playwright tests for:
- Scenario selection and loading
- Hero movement and combat
- Turn management and multiplayer
- UI interactions and game flow

**Playwright Features:**
- 📸 **Screenshots** on failure
- 🎥 **Video recordings** of test runs
- 🔍 **Detailed test reports**
- 🌐 **Cross-browser testing**

**Manual Playwright Commands:**
```bash
cd frontend

# Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Run with UI (interactive mode)
npx playwright test --ui

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/01-scenario-selection.spec.ts

# Generate test report
npx playwright show-report
```

### 📊 Individual Test Commands

**Backend Tests:**
```bash
cd backend && mvn test
```

**Frontend Unit Tests:**
```bash
cd frontend && npm test
```

**Frontend with Coverage:**
```bash
cd frontend && npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
```

### Test Coverage
- **Backend**: 100% core functionality tested
- **Frontend**: 88% test success rate (36/41 tests passing)
- **E2E**: Comprehensive gameplay scenarios covered
